# flow
Experimental.

# why?
We wanna create a flow of something. One of the goals is to 
be really precise with vertical positioning and have responsive 
flexibility for horizontal positioning. Also sizing. And learning.

# re-inventing the wheel eh?
Probably yes. Gimme a break, just trying to learn stuff here!

# will it work?
Probably... Maybe, depends on your use case.

# what is/are the use case(s)?
Do you care more about vertical positioning relating to screen size 
versus pixel perfect horizontal placement? 

Are you <rem>lazy</reM> daring enough to make your design function 
well on all kinds of screensizes and orientations without 
<rem>all</rem> most of those complicated `media` queries? 

Do you value being **explict** over being implicit? Are you comfortable
typing class names using whatever device you're using? then yes,
this *might* be useful.

# disclaimer
The horizontal positioning works pretty well but I'm sure CSS gurus
will declare it insane. Let's just say it's on the todo list. For now
it seems to do the job for the thing I intend to use it for so there's
that.
